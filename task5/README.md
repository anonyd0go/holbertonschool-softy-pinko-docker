# Task5 - Proxy server
This tasks consists of creating a [proxy server](./proxy/) image.  The client will comunicate exclusively with the proxy server.  This streamlines our aplication because the client only needs to comunicate with the app in one location (the proxy) and leave the rest to the application.
